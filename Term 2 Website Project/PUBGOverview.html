				<font color="#DE8D00">PlayerUnknown's BattleGrounds <i>(PUBG)</i></font> is an <font color="red">online multiplayer First and Third Person Shooter (FPS/TPS) Battle Royale Game</font> 
				developed and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of 
				<font color="red">South</font> <font color="blue">Korean</font> video game company <font color="blue">Bluehole </font>on <font color="blue">December 20, 2017.</font><br />
				The name "<font color="red">PlayerUnknown</font>" is taken from the main desiger of PUBG, <font color="#DE8D00">Brendan Greene </font>
				whose game IDs are named as "<font color="red">PlayerUnknown</font>".

				<font color="#DE8D00">Game Genre</font> Origin
			</h2>
				<img class="poster" src="Images/BRPoster.jpg">
				<img src="Images/BR.png" width="320" height="456" >
			<p class="singledescription">
				The game genre of <font color="#DE8D00">PUBG</font> is taken from a Japanese movie called "Batte Royale"(2000) where 42 students are put 
				on an isolated island and <font color="red">kill each other out until one survives.</font><br />This is why those games with
				<font color="red">"last man standing"</font> genres like <font color="#DE8D00">PUBG</font> are called <font color="Blue">"Batte Royale Games"</font>.<br />
				For <font color="#DE8D00">PUBG</font>, some of the clothes the characters from the movie are actually in the game.<br />
				For example, the school uniform of the female character in the <font color="#DE8D00">PUBG</font> trailer was from the movie.<br />
				If you want to watch this movie, go to <font color="red">Youtube</font> and <a class="ref" href="https://youtu.be/QAgjU9gxTB4">watch it</a>. (But, I don't recommend it. ^^;;)

				GAMING <font color="#DE8D00">PLAFORMS</font>
			</h2>
			<p>
				In <font color="#DE8D00">PUBG</font>, there are four plaforms you can play <font color="#DE8D00">PUBG</font> with:
			</p>
			<h3>
				1. WINDOWS OR PC
			</h3>
			<img class="pic" src="Images/PCPUBG.jpg" width="670" height="390">
			<p>
				This version is the very first platfom of <font color="#DE8D00">PUBG</font> which Early Access Version was released on <font color="blue">
				March 23, 2017</font> and fully released on <font color="blue">December 20, 2017.</font><br />
				This version is the <font color="blue">most famous version</font> and you can buy this game from Steam for <font color="#85BB65">$29.99 US.</font><br />
				However, in order to run this game, your computer requires some <font color="red">system requirements</font> like GPUs. So, this is why it is hard to play
				<font color="#DE8D00">PUBG</font> on Laptops and Macs.<br />
				So, the company later released <font color="#DE8D00">PUBG Lite</font>, a <font color="#85BB65">free</font> version of <font color="#DE8D00">PUBG</font> that is meant to be better playable on low-end computers 
				by having significant reductions in graphic details and other features on <font color="blue">October 10, 2019.</font><br />
				You can know more about <font color="#DE8D00">PUBG</font> <font color="red">System Requirements</font> in <a class="ref" href="https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/requirements/battlegrounds/15571">this Website.</a>
			</p>
			<h3>
				2. XBOX ONE
			</h3>
			<img class="pic" src="Images/XBOXPUBG.jpg">
			<p>
				This version is the second platfom of <font color="#DE8D00">PUBG</font> which was released on <font color="blue">September 4, 2018.</font><br />
				You can buy this game as a package with XBox One or just the game it self for <font color="#85BB65">$24.99 US.</font><br />
				They were actually thinking abot <font color="red">cross-platform play style</font> between the PC and XBox users, but it would be unfair since
				keyboard and mouse are better than joysticks in this case.
			</p>
			<h3>
				3. MOBILE DEVICES
			</h3>
			<img class="pic" src="Images/PUBGMOBILE.jpg" width="670" height="390">
			<p>
				This version is the third platfom of <font color="#DE8D00">PUBG</font> which was released on <font color="blue">February 9, 2018.</font> in China at first
				and was released worldwide on <font color="blue">March 19, 2018</font> with English versions.<br />
				This version was mainly developed by Chinese <font color="red">Tencent's Timi Studio</font> and both available for <font color="#85BB65">Android</font>
				and <font color="white">iOS</font> for <font color="#FFDF00">FREE</font>.
				This game is too was laggy to play if you had an old mobile device. So, the company released a version meant for 
				lower-end mobile devices <font color="#DE8D00"> PUBG Mobile Lite </font>on <font color="blue">July 25, 2019.</font>
			</p>
			<h3>
				4. PLAYSTATION 4
			</h3>
			<img class="pic"src="Images/PUBGPS4.jpg" width="670" height="390">
			<p>
				This version is the last platfom of <font color="#DE8D00">PUBG</font> which was released on <font color="blue">December 7, 2018.</font>
				You can buy this version for <font color="#85BB65">$29.99 US.</font><br />
				This version has <font color="red">platform-exclusive customization items</font> that other versions do not have such as costumes from the <font color="blue">other PS4 games.</font><br />
				<font color="red">Cross-platform play</font> support between the <font color="#85BB65">Xbox</font> and <font color="blue">PlayStation</font> versions of Battlegrounds was added in October 2019 following a testing period during the prior month.<br />
